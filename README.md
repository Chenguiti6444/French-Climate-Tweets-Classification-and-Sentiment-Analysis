# French-Climate-Tweets-Classification-and-Sentiment-Analysis
This project aimed to analyze and classify French tweets related to climate change and drought, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Initially, tweets were scraped using the `snscrape` Python library and preprocessed to remove noise and standardize text. The dataset was then manually labeled for polarity (positive or negative) and visualized through word clouds and co-occurrence networks to identify common themes and word associations. Machine learning models, like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and others, were trained and evaluated for their performance in predicting tweet polarity. Techniques such as oversampling and grid search were employed to enhance model performance. The project also explored the use of pretrained Word2Vec embeddings that were fine-tuned on the dataset to improve text representation and classification accuracy. 
The ultimate goal was to build robust models that could accurately classify the sentiment of French tweets addressing climate change related topics, and also, to provide insights into public opinion and discourse around climate change in the French-speaking community.
